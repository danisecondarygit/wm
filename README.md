Points:
 1. For the sack of simplicity get method is called on any model to get required collections. In a real world
  project this may shut server down especially on front side.
 2. For the sack of simplicity no authorization exists
 3. Server doesnt do any model update, so Request classe rules methods are considered simple (only for post method).
 4. I have considered attribute groups and attributes but you may interpret them as 
  attributes and attribute options.
 5. For the sack of simplicity whole code is authored in English.
